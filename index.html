				<h2>welcome!</h2>
				<p>There are a lot of details to consider when designing and developing a web site. In reality, it can seem like an endless list — but if you look carefully you’ll see that there are certain elements that are more important than others, elements that are used consistently among the most successful sites.</p>
				<p>Allow me and my team to design the best web site possiable for your business.</p>
				<p>So should your business have a website, even if your business is small and sells products or services you don't think can be sold online? My answer: Yes, if you have a business, you should have a website. Period. No question. Without a doubt.

				Also, don't be so quick to dismiss your product as one that can't be sold online. Nowadays, there's very little that CAN'T be sold over the internet. More than 20 million shoppers are now online, purchasing everything from books to computers to cars to real estate to jet airplanes to natural gas to you name it. If you can imagine it, someone it someone has bought it or sold it online.</p>
